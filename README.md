The goal of the Moral Drivers project was to create an autonomous vehicle capable of following a predefined race track with precision and stability. 
By applying PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control to the vehicleâ€™s motor system,
we optimized its responsiveness to track curvature and minimized errors such as overshooting or deviation from the track.
